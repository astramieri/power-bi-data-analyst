# Power BI Service

**Workspaces** are the foundation of the Power BI Service. 

When publishing any report, **you must choose a workspace**. By default, every user has access to *My Workspace*, which is ideal only for testing. When you want to share content with others, always create and use a shared workspace.

## Power BI Apps

In a workspace, you can create an **app**, which provides consumers a simplified interface to access reports and dashboards.

In the app configuration, you set up the app, select the content to include (limited to the current workspace), and choose your audience.

Once you create an app, you must update the app after each change to items in the workspace. The requirement to update the app allows you to control what version of the content is visible to your audience.

Apps are the **ideal sharing solution** within any organization. While you can grant access to the workspace, workspace permissions may grant users access to more content than desired. Sharing individual items also presents a problem if you make changes you don't want consumers to see yet.

**Template apps** allow you to find an existing app that suits your needs and then you connect your data. These apps can be a great way to quickly share insights with minimal effort.

## Refresh a semantic model

In order to support your ever-changing data, you can configure scheduled refreshes of your semantic models in the Power BI service. 

On-demand refreshes are also available.
