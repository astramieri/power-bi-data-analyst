# Create dynamic reports with parameters

**Dynamic reports** are reports in which the data can be changed by a developer according to user specifications. Dynamic reports are valuable because a single report can be used for multiple purposes. 

You can use **parameters** by determining the values that you want to see data for in the report, and the report updates accordingly by filtering the data for you.
