# Work with tables

Ways that you can build a common **date table** are:
- Source Data
- DAX
- Power Query

## Source Data

Occasionally, source databases and data warehouses already have their own date tables. 

These tables can be used to perform the following tasks:
- identify company holidays
- separate calendar and fiscal year
- identify weekends versus weekdays

Source data tables are mature and ready for immediate use. If you have a table as such, bring it into your semantic model and don't use any other methods!

## Mark as the official date table

By marking your table as a date table, Power BI performs validations to ensure that the data contains zero null values, is unique, and contains continuous date values over a period. 

You can also choose specific columns in your table to mark as the date, which can be useful when you have many columns within your table.

Selecting **Mark as date table** will remove autogenerated hierarchies from the date field in the table that you marked as a date table.
