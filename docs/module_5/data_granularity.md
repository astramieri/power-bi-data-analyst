# Define data granularity

Data granularity is the detail that is represented within your data, meaning that the more granularity your data has, the greater the level of detail within your data.

For different scenarios, you could settle on data granularity that is defined weekly, monthly, or quarterly. Generally, the fewer the records that you are working with, the faster your reports and visuals will function. This approach translates to a faster refresh rate for the entire semantic model, which might mean that you can refresh more frequently.

However, that approach has a drawback. If your users want to drill into every single transaction, summarizing the granularity will prevent them from doing that, which can have a negative impact on the user experience. It is important to **negotiate the level of data granularity** with report users so they understand the implications of these choices.
