# Combine multiple tables into a single table

The ability to combine queries is powerful because it allows you to append or merge different tables or queries together.

You can combine the tables in two different ways: **merging** and **appending**.

When you append queries, you'll be adding rows of data to another table or query. For example, you could have two tables, one with 300 rows and another with 100 rows, and when you append queries, you'll end up with 400 rows. 

When you merge queries, you'll be adding columns from one table (or query) into another. To merge two tables, you must have a column that is the key between the two tables.
