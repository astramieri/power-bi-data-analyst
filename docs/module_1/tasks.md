# Tasks of a Data Analyst

The data analysis process consists of five areas:
- Prepare
- Model
- Visualize
- Analyze
- Manage

## Prepare

Data preparation is the process of profiling, cleaning, and transforming your data to get it ready to model and visualize.

Data preparation involves:
- understanding how to get and connect to the data
- ensuring the integrity of the data
- correcting wrong or inaccurate data
- identifying missing data
- converting data from one structure/type to another
- making data more readable
- ensuring privacy and security (e.g. anonymizing data)

## Model

Data modeling is the process of determining how your tables are related to each other. This process is done by defining and creating relationships between the tables.

The model is another critical component that has a direct effect on the performance of your report and overall data analysis. A well-designed model with well-prepared data will ensure a properly efficient and trusted report.

The process of preparing data and modeling data is an iterative process.

## Visualize

The ultimate goal of the visualize task is to solve business problems. 

A well-designed report should tell a compelling story about that data, which will enable business decision makers to quickly gain needed insights. 

Many components of your report will help with storytelling. From a color scheme that is complementary and accessible, to fonts and sizing, to picking the right visuals for what is being displayed, they all come together to tell that story.

## Analyze

The analyze task is the important step of understanding and interpreting the information that is displayed on the report.

## Manage

Power BI consists of many components, including reports, dashboards, workspaces, semantic models, and more. 

A data analyst is responsible for the management of these Power BI assets, overseeing the sharing and distribution of items, such as reports and dashboards, and ensuring the security of Power BI assets.

Proper management can also help reduce data silos within your organization. Data duplication can make managing and introducing data latency difficult when resources are overused.
